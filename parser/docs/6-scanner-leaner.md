# Scanner String Processing Optimization

## Problem Analysis

The scanner's `emitStringLiteralToken` function contains an inefficient string processing pipeline that creates excessive memory allocations and performs redundant operations:

### Current Implementation Issues

1. **Redundant substring extraction**: `source.substring(start, endPos)` creates a new string that may be immediately replaced
2. **Expensive regex operations in `normalizeLineWhitespace`**:
   - `.replace(/\t/g, '    ')` - Global regex to convert tabs to spaces
   - `.replace(/ +/g, ' ')` - Global regex to collapse multiple spaces
   - `.replace(/ +$/, '')` - Global regex to trim trailing spaces
3. **String creation and immediate disposal**: The `rawText` intermediate string is created only to be discarded
4. **Unnecessary normalization**: Many string literals don't need whitespace normalization at all

### Performance Impact

For each `StringLiteral` token:
- 1x `substring()` call creating intermediate string
- 3x regex operations with global flags
- Multiple string allocations in regex replace operations
- Character-by-character processing that could be done surgically during scanning

This becomes especially problematic with large markdown documents containing many text runs, where the cumulative effect creates significant memory pressure and processing overhead.

## Solution: Surgical String Processing

### Strategy

Instead of extract-then-normalize, we implement direct surgical processing:

1. **Skip normalization when not needed**: Detect if string contains tabs or multiple spaces
2. **Direct character processing**: When normalization is needed, build result character-by-character
3. **Eliminate intermediate strings**: Process directly from source to final token text
4. **Single-pass processing**: Combine detection and normalization in one scan

### Implementation Plan

Replace `normalizeLineWhitespace` and the two-step process in `emitStringLiteralToken` with:
- `needsNormalization(start, end)` - quick scan to detect if processing is needed
- `buildNormalizedString(start, end)` - surgical character-by-character building when needed
- Direct assignment when no normalization required

---

## Implementation

### Character-by-Character Normalization

Replaced the regex-heavy `normalizeLineWhitespace` with surgical string building:

```typescript
function needsNormalization(start: number, endPos: number): boolean {
  // Quick scan to detect tabs, multiple spaces, or trailing spaces
  // Avoids creating any strings when normalization isn't needed
}

function buildNormalizedString(start: number, endPos: number): string {
  // Single-pass character iteration with space-run tracking
  // No regex operations, no intermediate strings
}
```

**Key optimizations implemented:**

1. **Conditional processing**: `needsNormalization()` performs a fast scan to determine if whitespace processing is needed
2. **Surgical building**: When normalization is required, `buildNormalizedString()` processes characters directly from source
3. **Space-run tracking**: Uses a simple boolean flag instead of counting to detect consecutive whitespace
4. **Single regex**: Only one trailing space regex remains (applied to final result when needed)
5. **Direct assignment**: When no normalization needed, direct `source.substring()` is used

### Performance Results

**Before optimization:**
- Every `StringLiteral` token: 1 substring + 3 regex operations
- Memory: Multiple intermediate strings created and discarded
- Processing: Character iteration happens multiple times (once per regex)

**After optimization:**
- Clean strings: Direct substring assignment (0 regex)
- Dirty strings: Single character scan + single character build (1 optional regex for trailing trim)
- Memory: At most one intermediate string created
- Processing: Maximum 2 passes through source characters

### Compatibility

✅ All 76 tests pass - full backward compatibility maintained
✅ CommonMark whitespace normalization behavior preserved
✅ Same token output as original implementation
✅ Same flanking rules and token flags behavior

The optimization provides significant memory and CPU improvements for markdown documents with extensive text content, while maintaining identical functionality and test compliance.

## Summary

Successfully eliminated the inefficient string processing pipeline in `emitStringLiteralToken`. The optimization:

✅ **Eliminated ALL regex operations** - Removed all regex operations from string processing  
✅ **Single-pass processing** - Eliminated double-scanning with unified `processStringToken()`  
✅ **Reduced memory allocations** - Uses array building and token caching when needed  
✅ **Maintained full compatibility** - All 76 tests pass with identical behavior  
✅ **Optimal path selection** - Clean strings use direct substring, dirty strings build efficiently  
✅ **Performance tested** - Large document test confirms excellent processing speed  

**Final Implementation**: The string processing now uses a single-pass algorithm that:
- Returns direct `substring()` for clean text (O(1) operation)  
- Builds normalized result in one pass for dirty text (O(n) single scan)
- Uses span-based processing - clean portions are extracted as substrings, normalization only builds what's needed
- Completely eliminates the previous double-scanning approach

**Impact**: String processing is now truly O(1) for clean strings and O(n) single-pass for dirty strings, compared to the original O(3n) multi-regex approach. This creates substantial performance improvements for markdown documents with extensive text content, with optimal memory usage patterns.
